# OpenGL Project Template

This repository provides a basic OpenGL project template or skeleton, designed to be used as a starting point for new OpenGL projects. It sets up a minimal environment with essential libraries and a clear project structure, allowing you to focus on developing your graphics applications.

## Features

* **Cross-platform build system:** Uses CMake to generate project files for various platforms (e.g., Visual Studio on Windows, Makefiles on Linux/macOS).
* **Dependency Management with Vcpkg:** All external dependencies are managed using [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html), a C++ package manager.
* **Pre-configured dependencies:** Includes common OpenGL libraries like GLFW (for windowing and input), GLM (OpenGL Mathematics), glad (OpenGL function loader), and stb_image (for image loading).
* **Basic project structure:** Organizes source code, resources, and dependencies into logical directories.

## Project Structure

* `src/`: Core application source code (`.cpp` and `.h` files).
* `ext/`: External header-only libraries like `stb_image.h`.
* `resources/`: Shader files (`.vert`, `.frag`) and other assets.
* `build/`: (Generated by CMake) Directory for build outputs (e.g., object files, executables, and intermediate files).
* `vcpkg.json`: Vcpkg manifest file listing project dependencies.
* `vcpkg_installed/`: (Generated by vcpkg) Contains installed package files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **CMake:** Version 3.10 or higher.
* **C++ Compiler:** A C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., MSVC on Windows, GCC/Clang on Linux/macOS).
* **Vcpkg:** Follow the [vcpkg getting started guide](https://vcpkg.io/en/docs/getting-started.html) to install and integrate vcpkg.
* **Visual Studio (Recommended on Windows):** While not strictly required, this project was developed and tested using Visual Studio. Using it is recommended for an easier debugging and development experience. If you choose not to use it, you will need to configure your own environment for building and debugging.

> **Note:** If you aren't looking to build off this template yet and just want to build and run this code, skip down to the 'Building the Project' section

### Creating a New Project from This Template

You can use this repository as a base for your own OpenGL projects in one of the following ways:

#### Option 1: Use as a GitHub Template (Recommended)

This repository is marked as a GitHub **template repository**, which allows you to easily generate a new project:

1. Navigate to the repo's main page.
2. Click the green **"Use this template"** button.
3. Choose **"Create a new repository"** and enter your project name.
4. Clone your new repository and start development.

> This creates a completely independent copy of the code that you can modify freely.

#### Option 2: Manual Copy (Local Setup)

If you're working locally or not using GitHub templates:

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenGLProjectTemplate.git
   ```
2. Rename the folder:
   ```bash
   mv OpenGLProjectTemplate MyNewOpenGLApp
   ```
3. Update the project name and metadata in `CMakeLists.txt`.
4. Reinitialize the git repository:
   ```bash
   cd MyNewOpenGLApp
   rm -rf .git
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit based on OpenGLProjectTemplate"
   ```
5. Push to a new GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/MyNewOpenGLApp.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

> **Tip:** Keep your own version of the template updated separately, and pull improvements into future projects as needed.

### Building the Project

> **Note:** This section uses the template repo name, 'OpenGLProjectTemplate'. If you are creating your own project off this template, substitute your directory/repo name.

This project uses [CMake Presets](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) for simplified configuration and building.  

Navigate to the `OpenGLProjectTemplate/` folder and run the following commands:

#### 1. Configure the Project

* **On Windows:**
   ```bash
   cmake --preset windows-vcpkg
   ```
   This creates a .sln file in the `build/` directory for you to add, debug, and run code with.

* * **On macOS:**
   ```bash
   cmake --preset macos-vcpkg
   ```

These commands will automatically create the `build/` directory, configure the project with the vcpkg toolchain, and install any missing dependencies.

#### 2. Build the Project

* **On Windows:**
   ```bash
   cmake --build --preset windows-vcpkg
   ```

* **On macOS:**
   ```bash
   cmake --build --preset macos-vcpkg
   ```

This will build the project using the preset configurations.

### Running the Application

After building, the executable will be located in:

* **Windows:** `build/Debug/OpenGLProjectTemplate.exe`
* **Linux/macOS:** `build/OpenGLProjectTemplate`

Run the executable from a terminal or file explorer.

## Customizing the Project

### Changing the Startup Project in Visual Studio

By default, CMake sets `ALL_BUILD` as the startup project in Visual Studio. To run the actual application:

1. Open `OpenGLProjectTemplate.sln` in the `build/` directory.
2. In Solution Explorer, right-click `OpenGLProjectTemplate`.
3. Select **"Set as Startup Project"**.

### Adding New Source Files

CMake is configured to automatically detect new source files using `file(GLOB_RECURSE ...)`.

After adding new files to `src/`, reconfigure the project:

```bash
cmake --preset default-vcpkg
```

Then rebuild your project.

### Managing Shader Files

Shader files in the `resources/` directory (`.vert`, `.frag`, etc.) are automatically grouped under a "Resource Files" filter in Visual Studio for better organization.

### Adding New External Dependencies

Use vcpkg to add new libraries:

1. **Search for a package:**
   ```bash
   vcpkg search <library_name>
   ```

2. **Add it to `vcpkg.json`:**  
   Add the library to the `dependencies` array.

3. **Reconfigure with CMake:**
   ```bash
   cmake --preset default-vcpkg
   ```

4. **Link it in `CMakeLists.txt`:**
   ```cmake
   find_package(<package_name> CONFIG REQUIRED)
   target_link_libraries(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC <package_name>::<package_name>)
   ```

Replace `<package_name>` with the appropriate identifier.

### Updating Vcpkg Toolchain Path

If your vcpkg installation path is different, update the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` in `CMakePresets.json`.

1. Open `CMakePresets.json` in the root directory.
2. Locate the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` entry in your platformï¿½s preset.
3. Update the path to point to your actual `vcpkg.cmake` file.
4. Save and re-run the configure step:
   ```bash
   cmake --preset <your-os-preset-name>
   ```

Examples:

```json
{
  "name": "windows-vcpkg",
  "cacheVariables": {
    "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE": "C:/Libraries/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "macos-vcpkg",
  "cacheVariables": {
    "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE": "/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
  }
}
```

Happy coding!
