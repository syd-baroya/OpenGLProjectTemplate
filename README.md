# OpenGL Project Template

This repository provides a basic OpenGL project template or skeleton, designed to be used as a starting point for new OpenGL projects. It sets up a minimal environment with essential libraries and a clear project structure, allowing you to focus on developing your graphics applications.

## Features

*   **Cross-platform build system:** Uses CMake to generate project files for various platforms (e.g., Visual Studio on Windows, Makefiles on Linux/macOS).
*   **Dependency Management with Vcpkg:** All external dependencies are managed using [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html), a C++ package manager.
*   **Pre-configured dependencies:** Includes common OpenGL libraries like GLFW (for windowing and input), GLM (OpenGL Mathematics), glad (OpenGL function loader), and stb_image (for image loading).
*   **Basic project structure:** Organizes source code, resources, and dependencies into logical directories.

## Project Structure

*   `src/`: Contains the core application source code (`.cpp` and `.h` files).
*   `ext/`: Contains external header-only libraries like `stb_image.h`.
*   `resources/`: Shader files (`.vert`, `.frag`) and other assets.
*   `build/`: (Generated by CMake) Contains the build files and compiled executables.
*   `vcpkg.json`: Vcpkg manifest file listing project dependencies.
*   `vcpkg_installed/`: (Generated by Vcpkg) Contains installed vcpkg packages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **CMake:** Version 3.10 or higher.
*   **C++ Compiler:** A C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., MSVC on Windows, GCC/Clang on Linux/macOS).
*   **Vcpkg:** Follow the [vcpkg getting started guide](https://vcpkg.io/en/docs/getting-started.html) to install and integrate vcpkg.

### Building the Project

This project uses [CMake Presets](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) for simplified configuration and building. 
Navigate to the "OpenGLProjectTemplate/" folder to run these commands.

**1. Configure the project:**

*   **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    cmake --preset windows-vcpkg
    ```
*   **On macOS:**
    ```bash
    cmake --preset macos-vcpkg
    ```
    These commands will automatically create the `build/` directory (if it doesn't exist), configure the project with the vcpkg toolchain, and install any missing dependencies via vcpkg.

**2. Build the project:**

*   **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    cmake --build --preset windows-vcpkg
    ```
*   **On macOS:**
    ```bash
    cmake --build --preset macos-vcpkg
    ```
    These commands will build the project using the configuration defined in the respective preset.

### Running the Application

After building, the executable will be located in the `build/Debug/` (Windows) or `build/` (Linux/macOS) directory.

*   **On Windows:** Navigate to `build/Debug/` and run `OpenGLProjectTemplate.exe`.
*   **On Linux/macOS:** Navigate to `build/` and run `./OpenGLProjectTemplate`.

## Customizing the Project

### Changing the Default Startup Project in Visual Studio

By default, CMake is configured to set `ALL_BUILD` as the startup project in Visual Studio. You will need to change this to `OpenGLProjectTemplate` manually in order to run it in Visual Studio:

1.  Open the `OpenGLProjectTemplate.sln` file in the `build/` directory.
2.  In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the `OpenGLProjectTemplate` project (or your desired project).
3.  Select "Set as Startup Project".

### Adding New Source Files

When you add new `.cpp` or `.h` files to the `src/` directory (or its subdirectories), CMake's `file(GLOB_RECURSE ...)` commands should automatically pick them up. After adding new files, you should re-run the configure step:

```bash
cmake --preset default-vcpkg
```

Then, rebuild your project.

### Managing Shader Files

Shader files (`.vert`, `.frag`, `.glsl`) located in the `resources/` directory are automatically grouped under a "Resource Files" filter in Visual Studio for better organization.

### Adding New External Dependencies

To add new external libraries to your project, use vcpkg:

1.  **Search for the package:**
    ```bash
    vcpkg search <library_name>
    ```

2.  **Add the dependency to `vcpkg.json`:**
    Edit your `vcpkg.json` file and add the library name to the `dependencies` array.

3.  **Re-run CMake configure:**
    ```bash
    cmake --preset default-vcpkg
    ```
    Vcpkg will automatically download and install the new dependency.

4.  **Link the library in `CMakeLists.txt`:**
    Use `find_package(<package_name> CONFIG REQUIRED)` and `target_link_libraries(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC <package_name>::<package_name>)` (or the appropriate target name provided by the package) to link the new library to your project.

### Updating Vcpkg Toolchain Path

If your vcpkg installation location is different from the preconfigured path, you will need to update the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` path in `CMakePresets.json` for your specific operating system preset.

1.  **Open `CMakePresets.json`:**
    Open the `CMakePresets.json` file located in the root of your project.

2.  **Locate `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` for your OS:**
    Find the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` entry within the `cacheVariables` section of either the `windows-vcpkg` or `macos-vcpkg` configure preset, depending on your operating system.

    ```json
    {
      "version": 4,
      "configurePresets": [
        {
          "name": "windows-vcpkg",
          "displayName": "Windows with Vcpkg",
          "description": "Configures the project for Windows with the vcpkg toolchain.",
          "generator": "Visual Studio 17 2022",
          "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build",
          "cacheVariables": {
            "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE": "C:/Libraries/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" // <--- Update this path for Windows
          },
          "condition": {
            "type": "equals",
            "lhs": "${hostSystemName}",
            "rhs": "Windows"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "macos-vcpkg",
          "displayName": "macOS with Vcpkg",
          "description": "Configures the project for macOS with the vcpkg toolchain.",
          "generator": "Xcode",
          "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build",
          "cacheVariables": {
            "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE": "/path/to/your/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" // <--- Update this path for macOS
          },
          "condition": {
            "type": "equals",
            "lhs": "${hostSystemName}",
            "rhs": "Darwin"
          }
        }
      ],
      // ... rest of the file
    }
    ```

3.  **Update the path:**
    Change the value of `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` to the new absolute path of your `vcpkg.cmake` file for the relevant preset.

4.  **Save the file:**
    Save your changes to `CMakePresets.json`.

5.  **Re-run CMake configure:**
    ```bash
    cmake --preset <your-os-preset-name>
    ```
    (e.g., `cmake --preset windows-vcpkg` or `cmake --preset macos-vcpkg`)
    This will reconfigure your project with the updated vcpkg toolchain path.
